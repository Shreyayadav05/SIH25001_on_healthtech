## Overview
A health monitoring system for rural Northeast India leveraging IoT sensors, AI analytics, and dashboards to track water and health data. Predicts disease outbreaks, sends early warnings, and empowers communities for timely action.

## Problem Statement
Water-borne diseases remain a threat in rural Northeast India due to unsafe water sources and delayed intervention. Existing systems lack real-time monitoring and predictive insights.

## Solution Approach
IoT devices collect live data, which is analyzed using machine learning. Results are shown on dashboards and sent through alerts to health authorities and villagers, enabling fast, preventive action.
